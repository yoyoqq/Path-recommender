# Path-recommender

As a part of a team of four who developed a software solution for a route planner of the London Underground tube system. Our model provides a quick and efficient way for users to plan their route and determine the quickest journey time between any two stations.

We carefully designed, implemented, and tested our software to ensure its accuracy and usability. Our solution includes a list of stations showing how the customer will travel from one starting station to the destination station, as well as the total travel time. Additionally, we created a histogram of the quickest journey times between each pair of stations.

As part of our own idea to augment the project, we included an additional feature that provides users with a table or graphic showing the list of stations from start to destination with corresponding times of how long it will take to travel to the next station. We also considered the impacts of the closure on the quickest journey times between each pair of stations.
