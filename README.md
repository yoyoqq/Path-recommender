Our team of four collaborated on the development of a software solution for the London Underground tube system's route planner. Our model offers a fast and effective means for users to plan their journey and determine the shortest route between any two stations using the Dijkstra algorithm.

To ensure accuracy and user-friendliness, we meticulously designed, implemented, and tested our software. Our solution presents customers with a comprehensive list of stations, showcasing the route from the starting station to the destination station, and the total travel time. Furthermore, we included a histogram that displays the quickest journey times between each station pair.

As part of our contribution to the project, we added a feature that generates a table or graphic presenting the list of stations and corresponding times to reach the next station. We also took into account the effects of station closures on the shortest journey times between each station pair.
